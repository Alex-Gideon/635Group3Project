negative,Back in February when India was still in denial about its brewing inflation challenge economists at Nomura Holdings Inc summarized the choices before the monetary authority into three neat boxes First they said there was a  probability that the central bank was right to ignore supplyside pressures   But their base case to which they assigned a  likelihood was that the Reserve Bank of India was wrong and it would have to pivot to containing price increases They did consider a third possibility to which they gave a fairly significant  chance that the RBI although wrong about inflation would simply go on to tolerate it   œThis is a scenario of fiscal dominance in which policy rates rise by much less than we expect in  but macro risks  both inflation and external  could be much higher than our current baseline Nomura analysts Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi wrote in a Feb  note œWe see a potential stagflationary outcome in this scenario  Fiscal dominance occurs when the governments finances  for instance the cost at which it borrows  take priority and force the monetary authoritys hand on interest rates hurting its power to fight inflation That isnt the case in India right now In early May when the fiction of transient inflation became impossible to keep up the Indian central bank surprised the market with an unscheduled  basis point increase in the benchmark interest rate It followed up Wednesday by raising the policy rate by another  basis points though this time the tightening was widely expected For now it doesnt look like the fiscal authority is keen to dissuade the central bank from doing its job  At  the pace of annual price increases is at an eightyear high and still climbing In other words its early days in Indias battle against inflation and the finance ministry might yet lose its nerve if in the process of containing price pressures the RBI pushes up bond yields too high complicating the governments plan to raise money by selling a record  trillion rupees  billion of notes this year  So far the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi doesnt seem to be rattled If anything New Delhi has announced a  billion package which includes tax cuts on fuel to help the RBI keep a lid on inflation That package is unlikely to be a substitute for more rate increases it might even enlarge the public borrowing plan To this add Wednesdays increase in prices for monsoonsown crops  including rice  that the government will pay farmers to procure their harvests for public distribution Money will have to be found for this too  RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has to assure New Delhi that its borrowing program would get completed without pushing the year yield much higher than the current level of around  a threeyear high The question is can Das really hold the line on longterm bond yields And will the government change its carefree tune if he cant Luckily for Das so far theres been nothing of the  bluster when according to a recent Al Jazeera expose by The Reporters Collective the top bureaucrat in the finance ministry had internally sought an investigation into then Governor Raghuram Rajans decision to keep interest rates high by which he was allegedly helping œthe white man  shorthand for investors in rich nations  at the cost of domestic investment and growth  After Rajans  decision to return to the University of Chicago the friction carried over to his successor Governor Urjit Patel came under pressure on everything from interest rates  which by now were being decided by a monetary policy committee  to his management of surging corporate bad debt and finally the question of whether the RBI had more capital than it needed   Patels deputy was mocked for warning the government of the consequences of raiding the RBIs coffers Following Patels abrupt resignation in December  his job went to Das a former financeministry mandarin who had executed Modis draconian currency ban in late  A new period of peaceful coexistence between the fiscal and monetary authorities began and gained momentum during the pandemic when such cooperation became the norm globally   But now the pandemic is over and new sources of friction are cropping up On rate increases the central bank and the finance ministry may be singing from the same hymn book but the question of the RBIs capital is beginning to simmer thanks to the lowest dividend the ministry has received from the RBI in a decade a little less than  billion or a third of last years payout  Crucially even this reduced dividend has been made possible by the central bank simultaneously selling  billion from its foreigncurrency reserves in the spot market and buying  billion Ignore the purchases Each dollar thats sold is valued its weighted average cost of acquisition in the past Since that figure is lower than the current exchange rate selling dollars for around  rupees today means a profit which is then shared with New Delhi Without this œactive conversion of revaluation gains into realized profits the RBI would have required a net capital injection from the government according to Observatory Group analyst Ananth Narayan   A reduction in the balance sheet also helped rein in the RBIs capital requirement and prevented its dividend from going to zero Narayan says That tug of war  whether RBI would give money to the government or tap it for funds  might remain in check once again if the central banks assets dont swell this year either That may well be the case since theres hardly any dollar inflow into India now only outflow Still the RBIs economic capital which according to Narayans calculation has already dipped below the minimum  of assets set by a  committee is a mindless constraint It would never have come about if the finance ministry didnt in the past lust after the RBIs capital To have to depend on politicians for money isnt a good outcome for an institution that has to project its autonomy to make its war on inflation credible   Indias fragile government finances mean that the risk of fiscal dominance of monetary policy always lurks in the background Right now it isnt a big threat because inflation is giving an unexpected boost to the tax revenue But as Nomuras Nandi says monetary tightening is œfar from the finishing line Barely two months into the job Das cut rates in a surprise

positive,ThinkStock PhotosIn every vertical of sustainability be it food clothing housing or resource conservation India already has a rich repository of practices evolved for a particular contextSustainability has imploded as an agenda with unprecedented scope and significance Indias movement for a Lifestyle for Environment LiFE is now in the global spotlight as a premier initiative for nurturing a pro planet people It is emerging as a consciously tailored policy for climate change focusing on reducing consumption at an individual level Embers of LiFE already exist in the country and there is much to learn from Indias environmental history Understanding the pivotal role of indigenous knowledge systems in preserving ecology is essential for shaping the future of Indian sustainability Hence the call for LiFE is about taking a walk down the memory lane drawing lessons for Indias future and implementing it on a larger scale India has also revised its starting point from state action to individual action Now the question is what kind of individual action will create longstanding sustainability in the country How can we chart a new course for Indian environmentalism through indigenous knowledge and experiences from the ground The answer is simple launching movements from the ground and mainstreaming indigenous practices but building momentum for the same is not an easy task  Each country will play to its strengths to achieve ambitious targets and India should also tap into its rich body of indigenous knowledge There is no one ideal way to practice sustainability in the country India has diverse physical and social divisions The history experience and expectations of sustainability in Meghalaya will significantly differ from Keralas The first step is toward building environmental literacy within communities When we talk about changing individual behaviour and lifestyle for the environment it must be noted that the individual and the collective are closely entwined for preserving the environment Practicing sustainability is about being consciously aware of how ones life affects the community and working towards overall wellbeing  In every vertical of sustainability be it food clothing housing or resource conservation India already has a rich repository of practices evolved for a particular context In  the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation recognised eight sustainable food systems worldwide out of which two are from Meghalaya and Uttarakhand in India The Khasi tribes from Nongtraw village in Meghalaya received global attention for their diverse traditional food systems like Jhum supported by livestock farming and other practices that respect local agrobiodiversity This enabled the village to produce and consume quality yield even with supply chain disruptions due to COVID Similarly the Bhotias and Anwals of Uttrakhand follow ancestral nomadism and agropastoralism which helps them meet  of the communitys food consumption needs This shows how traditional practices can build resilience in communities and aid climate adaptation efforts We can also take the example of Indian architecture The country is now rife with green building consultants but historically every part of the country had its locally suited green buildings Dhajji Dewri in Himachal Pradesh Jammu and Kashmir are traditional structures built by partially cutting mountain slopes It is best suited for the regions climatic variations while causing minimal disturbance to the topography Today it is impossible to travel to the mountains without considering the possibility of landslides and rocks hurling down due to reckless practices This is only a sneak peek into Indias depths of sustainable knowledge  Finally the only way to build a longstanding climate policy is by tapping into the strength of the grassroots and understanding the extent to which environmental movements can empower individuals on the ground Chipko movement received global attention and is a landmark in the Indian environmental movement but the starting point was at the community level A social and yet personal struggle of Chandi Prasad Bhatt to preserve the local forest resources escaped connected and thrived under the umbrella of eco feminism and peasants movement in the country If we look at the history of environmental movements in India be it Narmada Bachao Andolan or the Niyamgiri movement the first call for action always comes from the ground from a personal anecdote because fear is not thrilling when youre the one who is afraid Also the unique potential for LiFE lies in the fact that all humans all Indians are embedded and nurtured on the same earth Besides with increasing mobility and interconnectedness we know the extent to which a tropical cyclone in Odisha can affect neighbouring states and communities  Lifestyle for Environment should therefore emanate from Indias preexisting pockets of indigenous knowledge and the rest of the country should embrace these learnings from the ground India has the right policy ecosystem and governance support for reinventing its sustainability movement All Indian states incentivise ecofriendly practices like organic farming electric mobility and renewable energy infrastructure Adapting them to local contexts linking sustainability with community practices and sharing best practices with the world is the way forward to build momentum for a Lifestyle for Environment    Amit Kapoor is chair Institute for

positive,ET SpotlightThe fact that Indians shy away from discussing retirement plans has a lot to do with our lack of financial literacy Most of us have spent many precious minutes fantasizing about the day when we can retire and wont have to go to work We dream about a happy retirement imagining ourselves taking a break from all responsibilities However only a few of us will be able to live this ideal retirement life when the time eventually comes to do so  After a certain age were all faced with the responsibility of looking after our aging parents but we fail to remember that the same fate awaits our children too when we meet our retirement age unless we ensure adequate retirement planning ahead of time For example a stable retirement fund ensures that were never financially vulnerable and can afford any care we require   To be clear experts believe there are three important reasons why retirement planning should be a priority   You cant work forever Many of us want to work postretirement too But will the meagre income be sustainable Hence retirement planning is essential to be financially independent after you stop working The future is uncertain and you might have to make an unplanned large investment But will it be possible to execute this if you cant work Good savings and the right investment can help you through unprecedented times and challenges Health problems are unavoidable as time passes by Medical expenses are bound to make a dent in your savings and leave you stranded financially postrecovery India like several other developed countries lacks a social security system to care for the aged There is neither free medical care nor a monthly government payout on which pensioners can rely Even government employees who formerly had the security of a guaranteed pension must now build a corpus because the government has eliminated this benefit for most of its employees  So why are we not prioritizing retirement plans How long can we postpone an everlooming necessity Beyond the age of  one barely has the time and money to plan a joyful retirement If this rings a bell for you here are some of the best tips from industry experts to plan your retirement   Create alternate sources of income Keep increasing the contribution to your retirement savings every year Do not rely solely on security schemes  Keep risk factors in mind before investing a considerable sum of money Consider inflation Rs  lakhs today will not have the same monetary value  years later Stay away from excessive expenditure  Conclusion In an environment of rising inflation and market volatility its essential to have a retirement fund large enough to last you your lifetime Otherwise you risk being compelled to work during your retirement a situation that no one wants to be in  Sure you can take a chance and trust that your children will take care of you but that is a significant leap of faith to make And even if they are prepared to do so would you want to burden your offspring with the obligation of providing for your financial wellbeing in your old age  Maloo Investwise cuts out the confusion over what modes of investment to use for the highest returns on your retirement fund and provides you with a comprehensive financial plan that stands true to the test of time So with whatever little you have start today    Views are personal The author Dr Ramesh Chand Maloo  of MALOO INVESTWISE PRIVATE LIMITED is a Mutual Fund Distributor from Jaipur   Disclaimer The views expressed are of the author and are personal TAML may or may not subscribe to the same The views expressed in this article  video are in no way trying to predict the markets or to time them The views expressed are for information purpose only and do not construe to be any investment legal or taxation advice Any action taken by you on the basis of the information contained herein is your responsibility alone and Tata Asset Management will not be liable in any manner for the consequences of such action taken by you  Mutual Fund investments are subject to market risks read all scheme related documents carefully   	            This article is generated and published by ET Spotlight team You can get in touch with them on etspotlighttimesinternetin 	        T

positive,ET SpotlightWhat if in a football match there are  players running after a ball but there are no goalposts Doesnt make sense does it It doesnt  But when it comes to investments most of us make this mistake Most people do random savings and invest without financial goals As the saying goes œAn investment without a goal is like a traveller without a destination  Why goalbased investing Money can be a tool to accomplish greater goals in your life such as giving your child the best education pursuing your hobbies travelling to the destinations youve always wanted buying your dream home saving for your golden years the list goes on  Youre closer to achieving your goals when your money goes into goalbased investments rather than random savings Goalbased investing ensures that you save for each goal in advance which makes it more likely for you to achieve them Also it helps you match your time horizon to your asset allocation   Before investing your money you should know the Ks  Kya Kab Kitna  Kaise  ET Spotlight Kya  what is the investment for   Kab  when would you require this money If you know what your goal is and the time you have in hand its wiser to invest in equities that work best in the longterm rather than investing in shortterm assets and compromising the return   Kitna  how much money would you require You need to adjust the current cost with the inflation to arrive at the future cost   Kaise  how much do you need to invest Investments can be done via SIPs or lump sums Here you also need to define your asset allocation which will depend on your risk appetite You can get your risk profile test done to arrive at the asset allocation   Below are some of the behavioural and financial reasons why goalbased investment is a better way of investing   Avoid undersaving Goalbased investments make you think and enumerate your goals in advance This prevents you from miscalculating how much money youll need to invest for your financial goals Instead of random savings you will save the appropriate amount   Plan ahead save less achieve more Goalbased investing means lesser liabilities Heres how when you start saving for a goal well ahead of time you need to save less Why Because you will benefit from the power of compounding The earlier you start saving the more time there is for the investments to grow  For example you require a corpus of Rs  lakhs for your childrens higher education You need to save just Rs month for  years if you start at the time heshe is born But if you start  years later you need to invest Rs month   more every month  Returns are assumed at  per annum Investment amounts are for illustrative purposes only and does not assure any guaranteed returns    Save for a tangible outcome Think about the outcome of your investment When you attach a real outcome to the purpose of your saving youre more likely to work towards that goal It also discourages you from withdrawing or redeeming the funds in between due to shortterm market fluctuation and it keeps you on track    Guiltfree spending While some might find it surprising there are people who feel guilty and are uncomfortable with spending large amounts of money But when you spend money from an investment specifically earmarked for that purpose you will spend it without guilt     Achieve optimal returns Goalbased investing matches your time horizon with your asset allocation and you can allocate investments according to the time frame of the goal A bike is best for going around the city but to go to another country you need to get on a flight Similarly different assets work differently in different time horizons Goalbased investing ensures that you invest in the most suitable asset depending on your goals to ensure optimum returns For example if your goal is  years away equities would be the best way to go But if your goal is just a couple of years away equities might not give you the desired results  If you arent investing based on your goals youre just running in a field with a ball not knowing where to shoot Start goalbased investing now and win the game  Happy GoalBased Investing   Views are personal The author  Abhishek

positive,ANIMumbai It is said that too much money chasing too few goods is inflationary But that may be only partially true Empirical results of a study by economists at the Reserve Bank of India RBI suggest that money growth does not pose risks to inflation in the presence of economic slack  When the economy is in an expansionary phase however an increase in money supply can cause higher inflation implying that monetary accommodation during Covid by the central bank needs to be reversed once the economy gets back to its normal path of growth  Well known economist and Nobel Laureate Milton Friedmans theory which guided monetary policy through the world in the second half of twentieth century said that inflation is a monetary phenomenon and it occurs when too much money chases too few goods Excess money creation or unrestrained expansion in the balance sheet size of a central bank accordingly has been cited as the prime driver of inflation  But that is changing since the turn of the twentieth century across the globe and the link between money supply and inflation is weakening  even in India Empirical results suggest that money growth does not pose risks to inflation during an economic slack When the economy is in an expansionary phase however an increase in money supply can cause higher inflation said a research paper carried in the latest RBI bulletin  The authors are Sitikantha Pattanaik Binod B Bhoi and Harendra Kumar Behera from the Department of Economic and Policy Research The results of the research are that of the authors from the RBIs economic research department and do not reflect the views of the RBI itself  Empirical findings for India suggest that excess liquidity that does not lead to higher broad money growth is not inflationary the authors said Only a robust pickup in demand that can absorb the surplus liquidity in the system could be inflationary  The research assumes significance as central banks across the globe that were in quantitative easing mode post global financial crisis in  and went on aggressively expanding their balance sheets are now going for quantitative tightening Back home in India the RBI is being criticised for falling behind the curve in its inflation fight  The authors say that higher money growth may counterbalance the contractionary impact of the velocity shock rather than pose risks to inflation Also Friedmans theory is increasingly less likely to hold in the age of financial innovations rising digital noncash modes of payments for transactions and also in view of the emergence of FinTech for financial intermediation

strategies in India US Brazil and Korea In his previous role he was Head of Energy Trading at Futures First At present he is Director strategy at Estee Advisors and head of investments at Gulaq a part of Estee GroupInvesting in the stock market is becoming luring for people Many of us think of it as a tool to get quickly rich What investors lack is discipline and patience to stay in the market for the long term  To stay invested for a longer tenure one needs to understand the right way of observing the market  The market is no easy play as not everything you see may be correct and vice versa ETMarkets Smart Talk Srikanth Subramanian decodes factors that could derail momentum on DSt  The correct way to look at the market returns We usually look at average historical returns as a primary activity before investing This way of finding better avenues to invest is not totally correct It doesnt consider every factor about the returns thus may give an incorrect picture  Looking only at the average market returns at a particular point in time may give a biased result You may end up having too high or too low expectations Over a period of time stock prices show volatility  One of the ways to look at the market returns with accuracy is Rolling returns Rolling returns guide investors on the range of returns that are expected showing the highest return lowest return and average return for a given time period  Lets understand the concept of Rolling returns by the following example  Looking at the image below if you consider the period of one year beginning from January  to December  the market gave a return of  in the year  Instead an investor started investing in February  his return was  at the end of one year in January  Someone lucky might have started investing in March  and completed one year in February  with a return of   Thus these different oneyear periods show the series of possible market returns in a year   ET CONTRIBUTORS Looking only at the average returns may prove to be misguiding for the investors The whole picture may differ For example the Nifty  gave a  average market return for the last five years  This does not give the whole picture of an investor who has  years investment horizon Another noteworthy thing is the highest return for five years was  and the lowest return for the five years was   Apparently the time period of above five years has the lowest return in a positive number Therefore it is evident that the larger the time frame the higher the possibility of positive returns and a low risk of losing capital  Defining tenure can be a subjective term for investing but one can follow this general definition to understand the difference   What do Longterm investing and Shortterm investing mean Generally Longterm investing means staying invested in any financial asset for more than one year On the other hand shortterm investing means staying invested in the same financial asset for a period of lesser than one year Though these definitions are only correct from a taxation perspective  Individual definitions of long term and short term may differ for all of us For some it may be just a year but for others the long term can be  years   ET CONTRIBUTORS Looking at the above chart we can see that there are almost  chance of positive returns if one stays invested for at least  years Hence when thinking about investing for long term one should have minimum time horizon of  years though more the better   Why Longterm investing is a better option   Less timeconsuming One of the major benefits of investing for the longterm is you do not need to constantly monitor your investment In shortterm investing you constantly need to monitor the price movements This requires more time and huge effort  On the other hand longterm investing gives you a hasslefree experience Once you selected the fundamentally strong stocks you can choose to stay relaxed You just need to periodically check their performance    Higher returns due to compounding Compounding which was called the eighth wonder of the world by Albert Einstein has phenomenal power This element enters into the game of longterm investing if dividends and stock returns over time are reinvested The larger the investment horizon the higher the power of compounding and vice versa  Suppose Harshit and Ronak and Meet invest Rs  on the same day in the same stock and earn the same interest of  All of them decided to stay invested for  years Harshit thought of withdrawing the interest every year whereas Ronak and Meet chose to reinvest the interest  Harshit who chose to withdraw the interest every year would receive Rs  at the end of  years Whereas Ronak and Meet would receive Rs   at the end of  years  Now Meet wants to stay invested for further  years and wants to keep reinvesting the interest At the end of his  years of investment he would receive Rs  even with the same rate of interest This shows the real power of compounding    No burden of timing the market Shortterm investing requires a trader to time the market The practice of timing the market can make huge money on the one hand the investors may end up losing huge on the other due to wrong anticipation Due to the fact that the Future is uncertain predicting the market exactly is impossible  If you are a longterm investor you can be free of the stress of predicting future price movements and taking entry and exit decisions frequently    Negligible impact of shortterm fluctuations Price fluctuation is inherently in the nature of the stock market This tends to bring in human emotions and investors may end up taking wrong decisions looking at such fluctuations The recent Russia vs Ukraine crisis is one example Volatility which is a big part of the picture of shortterm investing is a very small part of longterm investing The large picture of longterm investing allows investors to avoid such shortterm fluctuations   Points to take care of when invested for the long term Following are the points you should take care of while invested for the long term   Keeping yourself updated about the news is not bad but taking entry or exiting from funds on such shortterm news can impact your longterm investment  Do not expect to get your return doubled in a very short span of a month or even a year  Do not think of beating the benchmarks in terms of return all the time If you are investing with discipline and consistency beating the benchmark would be of little account in the long term  Do not make any decision with emotional bias or intuition Rely more on data than anything else  To sum up longterm investing is a key to unlocking huge potential returns Though longterm investing is the plant that you do not need to water daily but taking care of it periodically is important   Disclaimer Recommendations suggestions views and opinions given by the experts are their own These do not represent the views of Economic Times  Disclaimer The opinions

positive,Mumbai A study of the Indian yield curve from the Covid pandemic times indicates that the longterm growth prospects of the Indian economy have improved and that there are expectations of a tighter monetary policy ahead said a research paper published in the RBI monthly bulletin  The researchers analysed government security yields with maturities of three months to  years for the period starting from the first quarter of  to the first quarter of   The empirical investigation focussed on Indias pandemic experience The slope of the yield curve steepened with the onset of pandemicrelated policy easing reversing after the recent policy tightening phase  The researchers found that the declining level of the yield curve pointed to a contraction even before the data release in   The yield curve is indicating an improvement in longterm growth prospects and an upshift in exante inflation expectations At the same time the fact that the yield curve has become steeper and concave reconfirms expectations of tighter monetary policy in the period ahead the researchers said  The results of the research are that of the authors from the RBIs economic research department and do not reflect the views of the RBI itself which the central bank has always maintained  The government securities yield curve is widely regarded as a valuable predictor of future macroeconomic developments  The research showed that in contrast to advanced economies it is the level and curvature of the yield curve rather than its slope that contain useful information on market expectations about economic prospects and inflation expectations in India  The results from a yieldmacro model indicate that the level and curvature of the yield curve have more information content on future macroeconomic outcomes than the slope This finding contrasts with the received wisdom and the experience of other countries the paper said  It found that the level of the yield curve has increased since  after a steep decline during the pandemic Furthermore the yield curve is concave compared to  levels indicative of strengthening prospects for the recovery higher inflation expectations and hence market expectations of frontloaded monetary policy normalisation

and Iain Evans   He was educated at the universities of Pennsylvania and Oxford Koch is the author of more than  books including the bestsellers  The  Principle and  The Financial Times Guide to Selecting shares that perform He is also a successful investor and entrepreneur with ventures including Filofax Belgo Plymouth Gin and Betfair    Rules to stop losing the investment battleWith his years of experience in the investment industry Koch wrote certain guidelines in his book to help avoid the unnecessary mistakes made by investors Lets take a look at some of these investment guidelines   Never invest funds you dont ownKoch says even if investors are able to they should not borrow money to make equity investments  However wealthy you are dont do it It has ruined millionaires and billionaires Dont let it ruin you The only thing to invest is money that you own which is not needed for any other purpose There must be no exceptions to this rule he says   Choose shortterm investments with great cautionKoch says if investors decide to invest for a relatively short period which means two years or less there should be a valid reason for doing so  The reason you have this time horizon is because you then want to use the money for something else school fees going round the world a house deposit or whatever It would be annoying not to have your starting capital when that time comes he says  Koch says the longterm record of shares is excellent but there is always a risk of a big fall over a short period and there is little protection in picking the most large stable and safe share because if there is a general market decline then blue chips will fall in line with the market  On the whole the stock market is not a good place for shortterm hot money he says   Do not overdiversify your portfolioKoch says investors should not over diversify their portfolio and never hold too many stocks as holding more than about  stocks does little to decrease risk  According to Koch investors should know the companies they invest in extraordinarily well which is very difficult if they invest in a large number of companies   It is better to know a few things rather well or one thing very well than it is to know something about a lot of things he says  Koch says another reason for investing in fewer stocks is that inevitably investors will pause longer think harder and weigh the buy or sell decision more carefully  You will also be more vigilant in keeping an eye on them and will stand a much less chance of missing any necessity to sell lighten or increase your holding But how many is too many It depends partly but only partly on the amount of time you have for your investments he says   Only invest if you are confidentKoch says before investing it is best to be confident about the medium and longterm prospects for the company  You should not invest because you consider the shares a strong bet You must first look at the company and assess by numbers or otherwise whether it has a good future of growth ahead of it one good way to assess this is to look at its past Then you must consider whether the shares are fairly priced undervalued or overvalued One of the advantages of having a small portfolio of five to ten stocks is that you will not be tempted to include a few speculative long shots he says   Never buy on tipsKoch says investors are probably approached from time to time by friends or acquaintances offering them hot tips based on rumours or information close to the inside but they should never ever buy shares as a result  For one thing it just may be inside information in which case you and your informant may be committing a criminal offence But even if the use of insider information was made compulsory it is just not a sensible thing to do You cant check the veracity or the importance of the data In some cases there may be a deliberate attempt to ramp the shares by those who have already bought and plan to sell soon Tips belong on the race course and even there they are usually wrong Avoid them he says   Do not follow the crowdKoch says investors should resist the lure of going with a fad as investors could probably beat the majority of investors only by following a different path  Stick to your investment strategy for the period you have set and do not be put off by analysts or be seduced by recommendations You must still convince yourself of course that you are right but unless you have important new information since you made your original decision do not be moved he says   Never average down when the price is fallingKoch says averaging down is an unsound principle which means adding to holding of a stock investors already have at a lower price than they previously paid for it to lower the average acquisition price  The price at which you first bought a stock is irrelevant to whether you should buy or sell now The only issue is whether with the information you now have the company has a good future and the shares are undervalued Only this should impel you to buy or indeed to hold a stock if you cannot confidently say yes to the two points above then sell he says  Koch has the following advice for investors if they are planning to average down    Only average down with extreme caution and after much deliberation   Do not do it more than once a year   Only do it if you are sure the companys future is good and the shares are undervalued   Do not allow one stock to take up more than a quarter of the value of your portfolio this is an absolute maximum not a target   Never average down more than once for the same stock   Never average down until the price has been stable or rising with at least one days rise for the previous three days   Never be afraid to sell at a lossKoch says some experts believe that investors should always discard the loss makers once they have fallen a predetermined amount  If a share has fallen relative to the market as a whole an important qualification the onus is on you to say why you should keep it You must have a good reason for doing so he says   Learn from your experienceKoch says investors personal experience of investment if analysed carefully probably will show recurrent patterns of behaviour   If you divide your historic portfolio  that is all the shares you have owned  into three categories organised by the success or otherwise of the investments its likely that you will gain a lot of insight by asking what is common about all or some of the investments in each category The aim is for you to categorise your investments as winners losers and average in all cases relative to the market then to look at the winners and find a few common themes about them either in terms of the types of company how closely you know them why you bought them or any other common factors Then repeat the process for the other two categories he says    Do not invest heavily when everyone else is doing the sameKoch says investors should not commit a lot of funds to the market when it is reasonably possible that the market is hitting a cyclical high  According to Koch one way to avoid this is never to invest when the market is within  percent of a record high   Balance patience and prudenceKoch says there are two opposite schools of thought and approaches that investors can undertake while making an investment decision  According to Koch one is the longtermist approach which holds that there are almost no circumstances in which investors should sell shares in a good company   According to this approach the trick is to find a few such companies for the long term as an investor and then just stick with them   Koch says the opposite philosophy is that markets are volatile and no one ever went broke by taking a profit   Which you prefer depends on how skilled you are likely to be at identifying even a few good companies Not many people are good at doing this although with the right training and encouragement to keep their eyes open many more could be he says  Koch says the best general position though may be threequarters towards the long term view  Koch lists some guidelines that may help investors make better investment decisions    Do not be too patient with your underperformers   Decide in advance if you have a target selling price above your cost price   Even if the share reaches the target price continue to hold nervously until the shares run out of steam   If you can afford to do not set a target price and continue to hold your winners for a very long time   If your shares double in value in a short time and you are thinking of selling sell only half or if you have to threequarters and lock the rest away  According to Koch beating the market is both possible and fun  If you fail cut your losses Hand your money management over to others and enjoy the rest of life If you succeed do something worthwhile with at least some of your wealth he says   Disclaimer This

positive,representative imageConsumer product companies expect a recovery in demand and profitability during the second half of the financial year due to good monsoon elevated farm prices fading inflationary pressures in the coming months and the low base effect even as they face slowing demand in the current quarter Electronics makers however said there are no signs of inflation ebbing in their segment and demand for entrylevel products will remain under pressure over next few quarters  Given the forecast for a normal monsoon this year coupled with a good harvest and farmers getting better prices for their crop I am hopeful of a faster rural recovery While there is an immediate pressure we expect rural demand to recover by endJune this year said Mohit Malhotra chief executive officer at Dabur India  During the JanMarch quarter earnings performance most companies blamed slowdown in the rural market for dragging the overall growth However expectations of a normal monsoon and elevated food prices have brightened the outlook for rural income in rabi and kharif season for FY In addition nonagri wage growth has started to improve up  in the second half of last fiscal after declining  in early FY  Volume or unit sales of daily consumer products people bought fell  year on year during the March quarter   Decline Sharper in Rural Areas   During the quarter shoppers cut back on household spending due to inflation and the Omicron wave dented sales industry officials said quoting Nielsen data This was the second consecutive quarterly decline in the fastmoving consumer goods FMCG market after a  volume decline in the December quarter The decline was sharper in rural areas that saw volume growth shrink by  during the March quarter while urban markets fell by      Marico Ltd managing director Saugata Gupta said FMCG market growth constituted a challenge in the near term due to high inflation and high base but demand and volume growth should improve towards the end of the September quarter This would be driven by the significant steps the government is taking to control inflation and lower base of the previous year Even rural demand should improve in the next four to five months with projections of a normal monsoon and stability in inflation said Gupta  The government took a series of measures in order to cool inflationary pressures including reduced central excise duty on fuel provide subsidy on gas cylinders and increased fertiliser subsidy These interventions are likely to reduce inflation directly by  basis points while indirect benefit can be another  bps We expect inflation to average at  in FY said a recent report by Antique Broking The lifting of a ban on palm oil export by Indonesia from Monday will aid margins too which in turn could slow down price increases that the companies have been making since several months   Emami Ltd vice chairman Mohan Goenka said while overall FMCG demand has been subdued the summer products portfolio has registered doubledigit growth for the first time in three years Inflation is impacting the recovery but we expect a recovery within the next two quarters The government has already taken steps to control inflation and markets are wide open If more stimulus is given by the government and there is normal monsoon the recovery could be even earlier including rural markets he said  Companies however said a bulk of their growth could still be driven by price increases and not by greater unit sales especially in discretionary categories Consumers are getting impacted by inflation in almost everything they buy and consume This will lead to conservation in the form of controlled consumption or downtrading in the next two quarters While the impact on essentials will be marginal other purchases may get postponed said Varun Berry managing director at Britannia Industries  Godrej Consumer Products said it anticipates a doubledigit top line growth with lowsingle digit volume growth Bottom line is hard to predict but if the cost moderated to Malaysian ringgit  for palm oil about  to  lower than where they are today and  for crude we should see some margin expansion especially in the second half of the year Sudhir Sitapati managing director at Godrej Consumer Products said during its earnings investor call   Consumer Electronics  The consumer electronics industry had forecast a recovery of mass segment products and a revival in rural markets in the second half of this fiscal but price increases of raw materials and consequentially final products will delay the recovery industry executives said Around  of the input cost are imported hence the industry expects prices will continue to go up by  every quarter Prices have gone up by  already including the latest increase this month  Consumers of entrylevel products are withholding discretionary purchases and buying electronic products only when there is a necessity So the boom in AC and refrigerator purchases due to the heat wave may die down due to product price increases and overall inflationary environment said Godrej Appliances business head Kamal Nandi

positive,ShutterstockcomOne of the issues investors often lament during a market correction is how they could not sell at highs and create enough cash to start investing during bear markets It is an interesting thought but in todays column I intend to debunk the notion that large cash calls are critical to wealth creation I will submit that cash calls have more to do with behavioural aspects rather than their statistical benefits when juxtaposed against their opportunity cost I will conclude that as investors we are far better off focusing on investible businesses and the price we should pay for them rather than inordinately worrying about cash calls If that interests you please read on  An important distinction here is about the fundamental fabric of the economy in which we are making these decisions An economy does well over a long time when a more people work and b people work more efficiently labour force participation and productivity gains With people ideally we should measure effectiveness and not efficiency but I digress In India more than  million people will join the labour force over the next decade and we are continuously finding more ways to be efficient Accordingly the conclusions for Indias investments will be different from what has transpired in Japan over the past three decades  Despite that retail investors in India own just  of the market  including mutual funds but that constitutes an even smaller percentage of their overall savings For a vast majority of retail investors stock markets are no longer considered akin to gambling casinos but we are still far away from where equities are a musthave allocation in ones savings  Nevertheless to this reading cohort I dont have to enlist the benefits of equity as in an investible asset class I will take it as a given In that case the only decision that we must make is regarding the approach To me using leverage is not sustainable as a universal strategy Leverage makes us terribly pathdependent If we buy a certain stock at  on leverage the fair price of which we believe is  and the stock dips to  before it reaches  we might be forced to liquidate We build an acceptable path for leverage to sustain based on what has happened in the past But increasingly things that have not happened in the past are happening all the time now markets had never corrected  in a month before COVID and no market recovery had happened in a straight line before  And any strategy where ruin is a possible scenario however low the a priori probability is unlikely to yield longterm success across all practitioners ergo not a universal strategy Works with a few and we celebrate the winners But those who leveraged and got wiped off we dont know them  If Indias economy is on a strong fundamental foundation and equity as an asset class deserves allocation within our savings and leverage is not an alternative the only question that remains to be answered is  should we always stay invested in the market or keep getting in and out either fully or partially  aka take large cash calls  The chart below compares the longterm returns of an investor who managed to invest all their surplus at the absolute market bottom dark red bar versus an investor who kept investing regularly grey bar Despite the huge market correction in the Global Financial Crises light red bar the difference in longterm returns of both investors is not material  The higher value of the red bar over the grey bar is assuming that the investor can accurately time the market The difference between the two bars then is the benefit of cash calls if you will Now let us look at the costs Over the last three decades  days if an investor missed just the best  days of the market the investor returns would have been  lower Miss  days and returns fall by a whopping    ET CONTRIBUTORS Put another way if an investor absolutely nails the market bottom the advantage he gains is minuscule compared to the costs  and  lower returns The risks are not commensurate for marginally higher returns in my opinion Why then one would wonder would investors focus so hard on taking these cash calls  I would submit that for many it is an emotional issue Investors dont consciously calculate the difference in returns that their strategy higher cash calls generates but derive huge comfort and satisfaction when they are able to invest in market corrections It feels like that strategy would generate superior returns given that we are buying during a market correction but an accurate assessment of opportunity cost is not done  I would propose a different approach to cash calls Rather than letting it be an input parameter markets are expensive so lets create cash let cash be an output of articulated actions For us a good business is a great investment only when we pay the right price for it Admittedly there are different ways to arrive at the œright price we use reverse discounted cash flows but when the price of the businesses we own gets too high and we do not get decent businesses to buy thats when the cash percentage should increase If that coincides with markets topping out so be it This approach will ensure an investors mental bandwidth is utilized in arriving at the right business to own and the right price to pay versus incessantly worrying about market movement and behaviour   The author is CoFounder  Director Buoyant Capital  Disclaimer The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer The facts and opinions expressed here do not reflect the
